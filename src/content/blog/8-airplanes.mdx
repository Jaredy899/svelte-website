# ✈️ The Magic of Flight

My love for airplanes didn't just happen overnight. My grandfather also loved going to the airport and his hobby was model airplanes. Neither of us became pilots for various reasons (some of which I talk about in [a previous post](/blog/7-fnd)), but we both loved the idea of flight.

## 🎮 From Simulator to Reality

One of my earliest memories is sitting in my grandfather's lap, watching him navigate through Microsoft Flight Simulator. Today, I still find myself spending countless hours in flight simulators, practicing approaches, learning new aircraft, and reliving those precious moments with my grandfather.

## 🌟 The Sensory Experience of Flying

There's something uniquely thrilling about the entire flying experience. The way the terminal hums with anticipation, the distinct smell of coffee mixing with jet fuel, the gentle rumble of engines in the distance – it's a symphony of sensations that never fails to excite me.

I've come to love every aspect of flying, even the ones that make others nervous. Turbulence? Bring it on! There's something exhilarating about feeling the aircraft dance with the air currents, a reminder that we're not just passengers but participants in this incredible dance with the atmosphere.

### What I Love About Flying

- The moment the engines spool up, that deep rumble that vibrates through your entire body
- The gentle push back into your seat during takeoff
- The way clouds look different from above, like a fluffy white carpet
- The subtle changes in air pressure that make your ears pop
- The way the world looks so different from 30,000 feet

## 🛫 A Lifelong Passion, and a Bittersweet Reality

Even though I used flight simulator most of my life, my knowledge of aviation became stronger after watching pilots on YouTube. I still spend hours listening to them explain how each of their airplanes works and love listening to them talking to ATC.

This deep dive into the world of aviation has only intensified my passion, but it also brings a touch of sadness. For various personal reasons, including my [Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)](/blog/7-fnd), becoming a pilot myself isn't a possibility for me. It's a bummer, to say the least, to dream so vividly of taking the controls and soaring through the sky, yet knowing that it's a path I can't physically pursue. Still, that doesn't diminish the immense joy and fascination I find in every aspect of flight, whether it's through a screen or from a passenger window.

## 🌅 Looking to the Future

My passion for flying isn't just about the mechanics of flight – it's about the freedom, the perspective, and the endless possibilities that aviation represents. Even if I can't be in the cockpit, I'll continue to live vicariously through the amazing pilots who share their journeys on YouTube, absorbing every detail and finding immense joy in their experiences. And of course, I'll keep flying as often as I can, cherishing every moment spent among the clouds.

The next time you're at an airport, take a moment to breathe in that unique airport air, listen to the symphony of sounds, and maybe you'll understand why, for me, flying isn't just a mode of transportation – it's a way of life.
