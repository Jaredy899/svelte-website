# 🍺 Why I Love IPAs

## (Especially Voodoo Ranger Imperial IPA)

There’s something about cracking open a cold IPA that just feels right. For me, it’s more than just a drink—it’s an experience, a ritual, and sometimes, a little bit of therapy. If you’ve ever wondered why people like me are so obsessed with IPAs, let me take you on a little journey, with a special shoutout to my all-time favorite: **Voodoo Ranger Imperial IPA**.

## 🌟 The Taste: Bold, Bright, and Beautiful

> *“The first sip hits you with a burst of citrus and pine, followed by a subtle sweetness that balances out the bitterness.”*

IPAs (India Pale Ales) are known for their bold hop flavors, and **Voodoo Ranger Imperial IPA** takes that to another level. Here’s what I love about it:

- **Citrus & Pine:** That unmistakable hoppy punch.
- **Tropical Fruit Notes:** A complexity that keeps every sip interesting.
- **Caramel Sweetness:** Balances the bitterness perfectly.
- **Rich Malt Backbone:** Adds depth and smoothness.
- **Strong but Smooth:** At 9% ABV, it’s powerful but never overwhelming.

It’s the kind of beer that demands your attention and rewards you for slowing down and savoring it.

Of course I have visited the New Belgium Brewery in Asheville, NC to have a taste fresh!

## 🧘 The Feeling: Calm in a Glass

Here’s where it gets personal. I live with **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)**—something I’ll talk about more in another blog. But for now, just know that life can get overwhelming, and my mind and body don’t always cooperate.

> *“There’s a unique kind of calm that comes from sitting down with a good IPA.”*

The ritual of pouring, watching the foam settle, and taking that first sip—it’s grounding. **Voodoo Ranger Imperial IPA** is my go-to for those moments when I need to unwind. It’s not about drinking to escape—it’s about finding a little bit of comfort and joy in a glass.

## 🍻 The Adventure: Breweries and Beyond

My love for IPAs has taken me on some pretty great adventures, but one brewery stands out above the rest:

### 🏞️ **Sierra Nevada: My Favorite Brewery**

Located just outside Asheville, North Carolina, **Sierra Nevada** is more than a brewery—it's a destination. The moment you arrive, you’re greeted by a stunning, sprawling campus nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains. The architecture is grand, with beautiful woodwork, copper accents, and a sense of craftsmanship that mirrors the care they put into their beer.

> *“Walking into Sierra Nevada feels like stepping into a cathedral for craft beer lovers.”*

The taproom is massive, with floor-to-ceiling windows that let in natural light and offer views of the surrounding forest. There’s a gorgeous outdoor beer garden, complete with fire pits, live music, and trails that wind through the property. Every detail, from the food to the friendly staff, makes you feel welcome and inspired to explore.

And of course, the beer selection is incredible. Whether you’re sipping a classic Pale Ale or trying a limited-release IPA, every pour is a reminder of why Sierra Nevada is a legend in the craft beer world.

  >*I do love visiting many other breweries wherever I go*.

There’s something magical about being surrounded by people who are just as passionate about craft beer as you are. Each brewery has its own vibe, its own take on the IPA, and I love trying them all.
