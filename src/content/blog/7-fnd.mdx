# ðŸŒ± My Ongoing Journey with FND: Still Searching for Answers

---

## ðŸšª The Beginning: A Fall in 2014

In 2014, I fell backward in my garage while carrying an item. This incident marked the beginning of a pattern of falls.

Over the subsequent years, I experienced:

- Missteps or stepping on unseen objects.
- Tremors followed by falls.
- These incidents increased in frequency.

From the outset, I recognized these events as abnormal.

## ðŸ¦  The Pandemic Years: Isolation & Adaptation

The COVID-19 pandemic altered my routine.

- I spent more time at home.
- This reduced my exposure to public spaces, thereby decreasing the risk of public falls.
- However, it also limited my physical activity and exposure therapy for fall-related anxieties.

## âš¡ The Seizure That Changed Everything

2021 marked a significant event.

My foot made contact with a table, resulting in a tremor, a fall, and a subsequent loss of consciousness. I regained awareness asking for assistance; my wife instructed me to remain still while waiting for emergency services.

> **This was my first grand mal seizure.**

This event initiated a series of medical consultations:

- Primary care physicians
- Neurologists
- Multiple diagnostic tests

These appointments generated numerous questions but few definitive answers.

## ðŸ§  Testing, Fear, and Uncertainty

In 2024, a 24-hour ambulatory EEG was ordered to capture a fall event.

> The awareness of being monitored for a fall increased my anxiety regarding falls.

Approximately one month after the EEG, my symptoms intensified:

- Unassisted ambulation became difficult.
- A planned vacation did not alleviate, but rather exacerbated, symptoms.

I subsequently took **three months of medical leave from work**. During this period:

- I initiated physical therapy (PT).
- I began sessions with a psychologist.

Both interventions have provided benefit; however, the diagnostic and treatment process has not been linear.

## ðŸ©º A Diagnosisâ€”But Is It the Final One?

After years of diagnostic uncertainty, a movement disorder specialist confirmed a diagnosis of:

> ## **[Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/functional-neurologic-disorder)**

I continue to work with my physical therapist and experience balance difficulties, particularly in unfamiliar environments.

While a significant component of my gait disturbance is attributed to a **fear of falling**, I also suspect that **[stimulus-sensitive myoclonic seizures](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/myoclonus)** may have been the initial trigger.

- Medication provides assistance.
- Physical therapy is essential.
- The condition involves a significant psychological component.

Symptom severity varies daily, and I am adapting to the **uncertainty inherent in my condition**.

## ðŸŒ„ Moving Forward

Living with FND involves ongoing questions.

I acknowledge the support from:

- My medical team
- My Physical Therapist
- My family

I remain uncertain if FND is the definitive diagnosis, but I am learning to manage my symptoms and regain functional capacity.
