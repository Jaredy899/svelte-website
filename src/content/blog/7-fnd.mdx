# 🌱 My Ongoing Journey with FND: Still Searching for Answers

> **Note:**  
> This is a personal account of my experience with Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). If you're on a similar path, I hope my story brings you comfort and connection.

## 🚪 The Beginning: A Fall in 2014

It all started in 2014. I was in the garage, carrying something, when I fell backwards.  
At the time, it seemed like a simple accident. But looking back, it was the first sign of a much longer journey.

Over the next few years, I noticed a pattern:

- I would misstep or step on something I didn't see.
- I'd shake a little and fall.
- These incidents became more frequent.

Really from the beginning, I knew something wasn't right.

## 🦠 The Pandemic Years: Isolation & Adaptation

When the pandemic hit, everything changed.

- I stayed home more.
- I got used to not going out.
- In some ways, this made things easier—I didn't have to worry about falling in public.
- But it also meant I wasn't challenging myself to stay active or confront my fears.

## ⚡ The Seizure That Changed Everything

2021 was a turning point.

One day, my foot hit the table. I shook, fell, and then—nothing.  
The next thing I remember, I was asking for help, and my wife was telling me to stay put while we waited for the ambulance.

> **That was my first (and so far only) grand mal seizure.**

This event set off a cascade of doctor's appointments:

- Primary care physicians
- Neurologists
- Countless tests

Each visit brought new questions, but not many answers.

## 🧠 Testing, Fear, and Uncertainty

In 2024, my doctors ordered a **24-hour ambulatory EEG**.  
The goal: to capture one of my falls on the recording.

> Ironically, knowing I was *supposed* to fall only increased my fear of falling.

About a month after the EEG, my symptoms worsened:

- Walking without assistance became difficult.
- I hoped a vacation might help, but it made things worse.

I ended up taking **three months off work**. During that time:

- I started physical therapy (PT).
- I began seeing a psychologist.

Both have been incredibly helpful, but the journey has been anything but straightforward.

## 🩺 A Diagnosis—But Is It the Final One?

After years of uncertainty, a movement specialist finally confirmed what I and some doctors had suspected:

> ## **Functional Neurological Disorder (FND)**

I still work with my physical therapist and continue to struggle with balance, especially in unfamiliar places.

I know that much of my trouble walking is rooted in a deep **fear of falling**, but I can't shake the suspicion that **stimulus-sensitive myoclonic seizures** may have started all of this.

- Medication helps.
- PT is invaluable.
- But it's still very much a *mind-over-matter* issue.

Some days are better than others, and I'm learning to accept that **uncertainty is part of my journey**.

## 🌄 Moving Forward

Living with FND means living with questions.

I'm grateful for the support of:

- My medical team
- My Physical Therapist
- Especially my family

I'm still not sure if FND is the final answer, but I'm learning to manage my symptoms and reclaim parts of my life.
